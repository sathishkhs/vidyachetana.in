                    Savitribai Phule was an Indian social reformer, educationalist, and a poetess from Maharashtra. She is regarded as the first female teacher of India. Our program to distribute bicycles to girl students is a tribute to the great reformer.
                    <br><br>
                    Today, especially in rural areas, the drop-out rate of girl students from school is increasing. Girl students face several problems such as unsupportive lifestyle, hostile geographical location of schools and colleges, social stigma, and gender inequality.
                    <br><br>
                    When we did our mapping and research, one of the girls mentioned to us, and we quote, “We are more frightened of rapes and human attacks than attacks by ferocious animals.”
                    <br><br>
                    This, unfortunately, is the harsh reality of India, especially in rural areas where homes are far and girls have to cover long distances to reach anywhere. It makes them vulnerable to sexual assaults.

                        <li>
                            Bicycles help them to commute easily without wasting time on walking, or waiting for public transport.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            CFTI is planning to distribute bicycles across Maharashtra by giving girls bicycles. We aim to help them in continuing schooling and even complete college education. This will also serve as a motivation for the girls and help them to commute easily.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        CFTI has the vision to distribute 100000 cycles to the girl students across India. So far, we have successfully distributed 4800 cycles in various parts of Maharashtra.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Our volunteers who are working at several grassroots areas carry out a detailed mapping of girl students in need of the bicycle and after getting accurate data, we distribute the bicycles to girls in dire need.

                        <li>
                            So far, we have distributed 4800 bicycles to underprivileged girl students.

                    Gadgets open up a window to the world for these children. Apart from online classes, they have access to extensive information and many times an opportunity to showcase their talent to the world. CFTI has pledged that no student should miss the online classes and numerous opportunities only because of the non-availability of gadgets. And as our commitment in action, till now we have:

                            Our representatives have mapped 1,500 students who needed tablets to attend online classes without any obstacles.

                        <li>
                            We select the students to provide these tabs based on our detailed mapping and research.

                        <li>
                            Each needy student submits an application to our representatives, requesting a tab along with their school progress report card, parents’ income proof and Aadhar card.

                        <li>
                            Once we receive the applications, our representatives visit their homes and verify the records with school authorities. Post this careful examination, an applicant becomes eligible to receive a tab from CFTI.

                    'Smiles4Birthday' is a CFTI initiative to bring a smile on the faces of underprivileged children. These children can barely meet their essentials and celebrating a birthday is surely a distant dream for them.
                    <br><br>
                    'Smiles4Birthdays' aims to make the special day truly special for every underprivileged child. We organize a small birthday party for the children with a cake, set of new clothes and a gift of their choice.
                    <br><br>
                    Every birthday party costs CFTI Rs. 5000/- and donations made for this project helps us to organize a small but memorable birthday party for a single child. We appeal to the generous donors to adopt a child's birthday having the same date as yours to make your as well as their birthday special and full of content.

                    Our distinctive program, known as the 'Small Grant Programme', is introduced mainly to disburse help to the people who are in urgent need but do not have access to the correct resources. Through this programme, we wish to create a ray of hope for the person who is in immediate need. For eg. if there has been an accident and an urgent surgery is needed or someone has to pay the fees to avoid cancellation of an admission in an educational institute. We verify applicants on priority and provide them with help within 24 hours. Unlike other programs, this provides quick and timely help to the needy person. 
                    <br><br>
                    We have also provided financial aid to a few local artists in order to fulfill their dream of creating a professional music video and traveling abroad to perform. 
                    <br><br>
                    We also support local sportsmen to organize small scale tournaments and competitions with the intention to appreciate local talent and promote sports in rural areas. We also provide legal assistance to those in need but cannot afford to hire legal help.
