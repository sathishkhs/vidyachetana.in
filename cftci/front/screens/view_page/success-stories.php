                    Rohit Krushna Naik, hailing from a financially disadvantaged background had a passion for education and a vision for success. His mother worked as a helper in a school, while his father worked in a small tailoring shop. His parents had a strong desire to give Rohit a higher education, however, given their financial status, it was all but a distant dream.

                    Mumbai's Dharavi region is also known as Asia's biggest slum area. In this densely populated locality, meager earners run their families mostly on daily wages. When the pandemic hit, the students from this area almost lost connection to education due to a lack of technological resources. CFTI conducted a huge campaign to distribute tabs to these slum-dwelling kids. They now have access to not only education but overall knowledge from across the globe on one single click.
                    <br><br>
                    CFTI also works extensively to run medical camps and other philanthropic activities in this area. We believe that our little effort will create a transformation in the life of people here.

                    CFTI largely conducts cycle distribution camps for girl students in the rural parts of Maharashtra to ensure that no girl leaves school just because she has no means to travel. During this journey, we came across a girl named Karuna (name changed), hailed from rural Maharashtra, who told us her story. Her father was jailed and she was left with her aunt. She was completely dependent on her aunt for the money to commute to the school in sitara (minidor van). The aunt was reluctant to give her money for travel but the girl was passionate about education. Her school attendance was severely impacted due to the non-availability of a mode of transport for her. The cycle provided by CFTI changed her life and brought her an opportunity to pursue her dreams. She could attend school regularly and her grades improved too. Thousands of such needy girl students are given cycles from CFTI.

                    Gajanan Balu Gharat, a senior citizen, was suffering from a severe leg injury. His son, being a poor daily wager, could not arrange for his treatment due to a lack of economic resources. Gharat was suggested a small but expensive surgery to save his life as his leg was infected with gangrene. His son approached CFTI for help. Under our Small grant program, we immediately arranged the funds for the operation. CFTI also ensured that Gajanan gets the best medical treatment and also arranged for his post-operative care.
                    <br><br>
                    Today, we feel contended that Gajanan is hale & hearty and completely recovered. CFTI provides such small but urgent help under our Small grants program to ensure that the aid reaches the needy before it's too late.

                    CFTI has always been at the forefront when it comes to healthcare and disaster management. During the Covid pandemic, we relentlessly worked towards creating covid facilities, providing beds, oxygen to the patients. We set up and operated a full-fledged 100-bed care center in Alibaug and made around 400 beds available across Maharashtra for Covid patients including 23 oxygen concentrator machines and 27 oxygen cylinders. We also distributed 500 free meals per day to patients in other hospitals and lockdown-affected areas as well. Our covid care center successfully treated  600 patients including a 96 years old lady.
                    <br><br>
                    In the later part, CFTI also worked extensively to get the people from the remotest areas of coastal Maharashtra vaccinated. So far, we have successfully provided free vaccines to more than 8000 people.

                    Coastal Maharashtra has been hit by natural disasters in the last couple of years. It became challenging for people to deal with these disasters while suffering through the covid pandemic on the other hand. Be it floods or cyclones, our volunteers have worked around the clock to provide relief at several calamity-struck areas in western India.
                    <br><br>
                    CFTI distributed more than 1,00,000 free-cooked meals, over 25,000 kgs of dry grocery, over 10,000 liters of drinking water and other essentials to the calamity-affected people from around western India. The entire Kevnale village has been adopted by CFTI for complete rehabilitation.
