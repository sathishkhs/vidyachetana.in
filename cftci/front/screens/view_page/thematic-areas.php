                    India’s literacy rate is 77.7%, of which, urban India accounts for 87.7% rate and rural India is only at 73.5%. Several factors are at play for rural India children missing out on holistic education. Some of them being lack of resources, poor availability of schools, financial condition, poor transportation, etc. Education is our primary service area and it is our aim to make education available even in the remotest areas. In our effort to ensure that each child is able to learn, grow and live a good life, we have so far:

                    <ul style="color: #333333;">
                        <li>Awarded scholarship to 580 students from various grades i.e. from kindergarten to post graduation</li>
                        <li>Constructed 93 classrooms for various rural schools</li>
                        <li>Donated 23 computers to various rural schools</li>
                        <li>Donated academic kits to 1,250 underprivileged rural students</li>
                        <li>Donated 700 tabs to underprivileged students to continue education during the Covid 19 pandemic. This is an ongoing project. Visit us at <a href="http://www.schoolontab.org" target="_blank">www.schoolontab.org</a></li>
                        <li>Donated over 4800 bicycles to underprivileged girl students so that they can continue their education. This will also help to reduce drop-out rates.</li>
                        <li>Children from the tribal community face tougher situations to even get primary education. We put together an academic kit consisting of a school bag, textbooks, note books, compass box, pen, school uniforms, shoes, umbrella, tiffin box, water bottle and writing pads and distributed it to 60 tribal children.</li>
                        <li>We also provided 125 benches to various schools to ensure students have the perfect setting of a school. We are in the process of identifying more schools that need benches.</li>

                We have come across many inspiring stories of women during our journey and it only makes us want to do more for them. We have kick-started several projects and have many plans in the pipeline to empower women and help them in every way.
                <br><br>
                Under our program 'Savitrichya Leki Chalalya Pudhe', we distribute cycles to school and college girl students who need it the most, especially in the rural areas. Lack of proper transportation facilities in rural India hinders these girl students to continue their education. These cycles help them to travel to schools and colleges, even if it is far away from their home. Maharashtra had a great woman leader, Savitribai Phule, a pioneer, thinker and a reformer who spearheaded the girl-child education and this project is our humble tribute to her.
                <br><br>
                We have conducted various skill development courses for women who are associated with self-help groups formed under the huge Raigad Zilla Mahila Bachatgat Sakshamikaran Foundation. The skills training workshops included tailoring, beauty treatments, jewellery-making, cooking and candle-making.
                <br><br>
                On World Menstrual Hygiene Day, we distributed sanitary pads to 400 women living in slums and conducted awareness seminars about menstrual hygiene.

                    Health-care facilities in rural India still remain inaccessible to many underprivileged people who cannot afford it. We aim to provide health-care facilities to those deprived of quality and timely health-care services. We have undertaken several projects in rural India and have conducted help-drives in urban areas as well.
                    <br><br>
                    We have supported medical expenses to the number of underprivileged people who are under chemotherapy, for breast cancer surgery, and leg amputation surgery.
