                            <i class="about-page__right-text">I am Sahana, studying final year BTech in Presidency University, Bangalore. I come from an economically backward family. We are two siblings and my father has been bed ridden since 6 years. My mother is a teacher in a private school and is the sole earning members in our family. When I secured a seat in BTech, I had no means to support myself to take up the course, considering our financial status. Youth For Seva helped me to pursue my education by providing financial and mentoring support. I recently secured a placement in IBM, Bangalore. I am extremely grateful to Youth for Seva , Vidya Chetana for the invaluable assistance to help me to achieve my goal.</i>
