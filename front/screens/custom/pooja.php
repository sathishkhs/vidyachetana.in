                            <i class="about-page__right-text">Hi all, I am Pooja. I am a proud beneficiary of Vidya Chetana scholarship. With the help of this scholarship, I could score 98.72 in my SSLC exam, which added wings to my dream of becoming an engineer. I am currently studying in BMS College of Engineering. For me, life was not very easy. My parents were struggling to make two ends meet. My mother works as domestic help, and my father runs a small shop. I used to study well, but I was always worried about how I could continue my higher education considering our financial background, then stepped in Vidya Chetana scholarship by Youth for Seva in my life. YFS team told me that I only need to study, and they will take care of my education expenses, there was nothing like it. Thanks to my donor, the entire team of Vidya Chetana, and Youth for Seva.</i>
