                            <p class="introduction__right-text">One day, while looking out of a window in Mayapur, a small hamlet near Calcutta, Srila Prabhupada saw a group of children fighting with stray dogs over scraps of food. Deeply moved by this incident, he resolved to ensure that no one within a ten mile radius of his centre would go hungry. This direction to his followers inspired the genesis of various charitable feeding initiatives.</p>
